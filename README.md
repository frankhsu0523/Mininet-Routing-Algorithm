Maximum concurrent flow problem (MCFP) in Mininet
=================================================
The object of this project is to evaluate the offline algorithms' performance for MCFP. We use Mininet to simulate the Software-Defined Network environment. The algorithm will create the path of demand in advance. Then we set up the path in Mininet and start the traffic for the evaluation.
