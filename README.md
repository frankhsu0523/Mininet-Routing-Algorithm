Implementation and Evaluation of Offline Routing Algorithms in Mininet
=================================================
The object of this project is to evaluate the offline algorithms' performance. We use Mininet to simulate the network environment. The algorithm will create the paths of demands in advance. Then we set up the path in Mininet and start the traffic for the evaluation.
